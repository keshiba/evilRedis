What is Redis?

To answer that question, go to - [redis/redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)


What is evilRedis?
------------------
evilRedis is the devil re-incarnation .... umm, blah blah.

Why evilRedis?
---------------
1. Was bored
2. Needed to re-learn C
3. I knew much about redis and thought that it would be the apt playground to learn c again
4. Was exploiting buffer overflows and writing shellcodes recently (harmless CTFs of course)
5. All of that just came together I guess

#### It was an accident! Honestly...

I promise I'll work on the README, as and when I add more horns to evilRedis.

Until then,
Enjoy!
